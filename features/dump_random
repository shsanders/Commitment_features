Without a representative (electing) body, we don't get leaders. Ultimately, the people decide who is in power... at least in our flawed version of a Representative Republic.

TEXT:1. I think someone's life is far less valuable than my own if they are a violent rapist or serial killer, and they have lost their right to live in my eyes, when they chose to take or ruin someone else's.

2. It is sad, and there is imperfection in every system, however, to say it shouldn't be done because of the innocent people who are falsely executed is surely the same as saying there should be no jail sentences for anyone, without indisputable evidence. There should be no shying away from decisive punishment just because the punishment is severe.

3. I agree with this point, every defendant should have equal opportunities, and it is a problem which needs to be overcome.

4. Correlation doesn't neccessarily equal cause. Perhaps there is a hidden factor, such as the US' carelessness over the population owning guns. I am not suggesting this IS the hidden factor, it is just an idea.

5. This is a stupid point, the line can be drawn easily and I am sure no-one will begin to 'shoot jaywalkers'

TEXT:Listen, there are many murders and killings committed in scriptures even by those who are used by God. Did God overlook those murders? No way. There are always consequences for sin. You have to look at each one individually to know the details. That is the problem with the arguments of most atheists or skeptics. They peruse scripture for tidbits and then say "what about this? or That?"
Just like the elections, throw a ton of mud and see if any sticks.

Here is a quick answer to this scripture.

"Elisha (with help from God) sent two bears to kill 42 children for making fun of his bald head. 2 Kings 2:22-23"

The word Children in this passage is the "NAHAR". It is a masculine noun. So right away, we know that we are dealing with boys. Now, the word has a few meanings that are derived by the context of the passage. One of its uses is for new-borns. New-born boys cannot run let alone tease a man. They were not babies. The other uses I found were for twenty-somethings, male servants, or common soldiers. This passage does not make it totally clear which of the other three uses intended here, but it's safe to say that theses were not little kids tugging at his robe. (or whatever he wore)

There is also a cultural thing. The bald-headed comment, in those days, was actually white haired men which is kind of like saying "You old fool!" God justly put these males to death because God will not be mocked. Elisha was bringing God's word and God's word was being mocked.

TEXT:That is overwhelmingly not the norm. You are saying that we shouldn't kill any murderers because they may be innocent? What about the ones that are guilty, but aren't killed?

TEXT:while 'kill them all' is a little extreme heading, I believe the death penalty is the most formal way of dealing with murderers. 
To me, society is a tacit agreement, and when you forsake that bond by murdering someone, you are not privy to the protection of the society whose laws you decided to disregard. Therefore, you would be at the mercy of the society you turned your back on. The death penalty is an institutional way of dealing with murderers, because as a member of this tacit society, I would gladly rid of someone who would place their self above someones, or even my own life.

if you disagree with me, please read up on some social contract theory to at least see where I am coming from, and have it explained better than I can.

(as a few protective points: I think the death penalty is best used only on repeat offenders. I also would gladly 'rid' of someone by other means than by violent murder like I'm sure someone will suggest I am advocating)

Would you rather be alive or dead?

Are you religious?

TEXT:ok.
really nit-picky here:
whoever comes up with these debate topics needs help.
here's why:
the death "sentence" is not wrong.
the death "penalty" is not either.
actually doing it could be.
the death sentence allows for the possibility.
the death penalty is the law on the books.
so what?
there are lots of laws on the books that allow
for the possibility of punishment, but are never used.
and yes, the death penalty is a Big Damn Deal, but it's
just another law. some countries have it, others don't.
vote.
that's our BDD.

TEXT:"retribution in it's own right should NOT be a reason for a death penalty."

What if the sentence is not as a form of retribution, but rather a way of ensuring public safety? Don't people have the right to expect that they are protected from recidivist criminals who are violent and uncontrollable? 
What about other prisoners who haven't done anything violent. Should a drunk driver have to run the risk of dying a violent death because we are attempting to contain a violent individual?

TEXT:Many people are surprised to find that the states spend more money, on average, executing criminals than they do keeping them in prison for life. But to use money as an argument for whether someone lives or dies is crass, isn't it?

As a deterrent - by what right do we make an example of one person? Should we pull his pants down in public and expose his small genitalia, thus demonstrating that all criminals have an inferiority complex? Or perhaps chop off his hands as a warning?

The only argument that can really be justified is that of prevention: preventing the criminal from repeating his/her crimes. On that basis, send him to a paradise island... he won't come back to bother you again, and you need worry no further about the matter.

TEXT:I didn't mean to put as much emphasis on learning about criminals as you seem to have extracted from my comments. It's not the only reason I'm against the death penalty, and isn't even my #1 reason, but it is something to consider. I don't think asking me how many people must be studied and at what cost is making any point, it's just avoiding the comment itself. And of course since I'm not the one studying the problem of crime prevention, I would have no answer for you anyhow.

However, saying that I'm not speaking in the spirit of the topic because I'm not against the death penalty for the same reasons as most is a little myopic don't you think? I do agree that we shouldn't be executing such a penalty with such finality for moral reasons as well. You teach the lesson that killing is wrong and then you (as a society) kill as a form of punishment. It's not logical or moral either if you ask me. There is an issue of practicality too though. If you argue whether a mass murderer "should" be put to death, then it's an easy argument. Yes, they probably should. However, I don't believe that's our responsibility to carry out such an execution, which is nothing more than a means of exactly revenge.

Also, studies "are" being done on extremely violent criminals in an attempt to learn more about their behavior, so it is a consideration, although I'm not enough of an expert to know how much of one. Just a point I thought I'd bring up.

I disagree with you when you suggest that having the highest incarceration rate should have more of an effect on crime rates or safety indexes. There's a lot more involved in that topic that would contribute to an overall safety index than just a stat like that. I don't think this has a connection to the death penalty because 5 out of the 6 countries with the lowest crime rates have a ban on the death penalty. That may suggest that the death penalty is not a necessary deterrent.
