So now, just because some religious folk look around and don't understand the natural world (like the cavemen didn't), and further because they don't even WANT to understand the natural world, there MUST be a god. Wow - I could claim anything this way. ("I don't understand how a computer works - God did it. I don't understand how an airplane works - God did it. I don't understand my homework - GOD!!")

So now a few billion years is a short time? Ok. So how many years would be about enough in your expert opinion? 

If there were only one planet in the universe, then yeah, I'd agree with you - chances are pretty much nil that life like us would appear. But how many billions of planets are there out there? Quite a few. That increases the probability quite a bit.

Where's your soul by the way? If your arm gets amputated, does 1/6th of your soul go along with it? Or does your soul stay comfortably in your brain somewhere, in among the cells and atoms? What the heck is a soul anyhow? Please share.

I do find it interesting that you are so readily willing to accept "The Big Bang produced both SPACE and TIME. There was NOTHING outside the big bang and there was NOTHING before it either." 

This is interesting because accepting that quote from your "Vlog" (or whatever they call it nowadays) brings about the exact same philosophical consequences as creationism does. Its the same old tired rebuttal, "If God created the Universe, then what created God?". Well if you dont believe in God how is it that you can say there was NOTHING before the big bang? What created all of the things in your balloon? I personally accept the idea that there are things that have always been and always will be, things without a beginning and an end. I'm just confused because It seems to me that you are not against the notion of things "poofing" into existence, but you are against it when anyone suggests there may have been a "poofer" (one who does the poofing) which is totally contradictory to your quote.

TEXT:Scientists change their best guess because the are not coming up with conclusions based on faith. They're looking for the best answer at all times.

Religion states what they want the answer to be and ignores evidence to the contrary.

Remember, Gravity is only a theory as well, but we all trust in it right now. Maybe some day we'll find out there is some other force at work, but gravity theory makes sense and is scientific so we keep it. 

Likewise evolution. If everything was created, and some species went extinct, that means they were either created imperfectly, or created without a purpose. Doesn't seem too likely from an all knowing creator. However, if species DO randomly mutate, and all the strong ones survive it makes sense. I challenge you to come up with an alternate explination for the origin of the species that is MORE observable, MORE reproducable, and MORE scientific than evolution.

TEXT:I have never read a high school biology text book with a chapter devoted entirely to slamming religion.The reason for this is that scientists justify their findings on their own merit. They have no need to slam other areas like creationism. Creationism does not provide evidence to support itself so it needs to slam science in order to justify itself. 

Evolution has not been cast out by scientists. Maybe it doesn't look the same as when Darwin proposed it, but that's because scientists are interested in progress and improving theories. Additionally, there is proof of evolution in the form of speciation (there is other assorted proof, but I'm not a biologist so I won't try to explain it). For instance, a new mosquito has developed that is specifically adapted to live in London metro tunnels. This insect did not previously exist (which makes sense as there were no metro tubes, before metro tubes were built). 

Claiming that evolution should not be taught as it inflicts harm on and is unfair to religion is a weak argument. Evolution is not a belief system. Most developed nations are founded with freedom of religion in mind. In this vein, people are therefore guaranteed freedom to pursue no religion. Teaching creationism is akin to teaching religion. If it is taught in public schools, the children's right to freedom of religion is being violated. 

Furthermore, Pope John Paul II himself is quoted as saying "In his encyclical Humani Generis (1950), my predecessor Pius XII has already affirmed that there is no conflict between evolution and the doctrine of the faith regarding man and his vocation, provided that we do not lose sight of certain fixed points....Today, more than a half-century after the appearance of that encyclical, some new findings lead us toward the recognition of evolution as more than a hypothesis. In fact it is remarkable that this theory has had progressively greater influence on the spirit of researchers, following a series of discoveries in different scholarly disciplines. The convergence in the results of these independent studies  which was neither planned nor sought  constitutes in itself a significant argument in favor of the theory."

Finally, most Christian denominations do not enforce a literal interpretation of the Genesis story. Most allow it to be read as allegorical.

TEXT:Evolution has no solid evidence. Look it up.
Most of the materials used in evolutionist textbooks have been proved false long ago.

National Geographic printed an article on our supposed evolution from birds, showcasing the fossil of a bird that was supposedly the intermediate stage between people and dinosaurs. 

A few months later, it turned out that the "fossil" was simply bones from two dinosaurs glued together. Look it up.

Evolution is a theory, just like creationism. Neither of these theories has enough proof to finalise them.

TEXT:"Third, teaching evolution in no way forces kids to believe it, merely understand it. "



It is obvious that you cannot make kids believe anything. BUT, In far too many classrooms, children are told that evolution is proven fact. So the motive is not for the child to "merely understand". It quietly requires them to believe it.

TEXT:"I thought to myself, If evolution is so solid, why do
they continue to publish false and disproven findings
in our textbooks?"

Evolutionary theory is not founded on Haeckel's observations or theories. Haeckel's work was discredited in the 19th century, and has not been relevant to biology since the rediscovery of Mendel's laws of genetics. That the biogenetic law is false has been the consensus of biologists for over 100 years, and developmental biologists have been working constructively to provide alternative explanations, which have so far all been evolutionary in nature.

The similarities between vertebrate embryos are real. We must distinguish between observations of those similarities and hypotheses about their causes. The similarities are not in doubt; there are worthwhile studies of the degree and timing of the similarities, but none that question their overall existence. What Wells has described is one hypothesis about the cause, Haeckel's biogenetic law, which failed early and spectacularly. He has not addressed any modern hypotheses, nor has he provided a better alternative.

Evidence for common descent lies in the unity of form and process. We do not use Haeckel's outmoded, invalid mechanism to argue for evolution. Instead, we look at the marvelous convergence of disparate organisms on common principles: all animals use the same genes to define regions of their bodies, all vertebrates build their faces by unlikely rearrangements of odd pharyngeal protrusions, and even tailless mammals like us have to start with tailed embryos. The best explanation for these phenomena is that they are a consequence of a common heritage.
